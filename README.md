Data Professional leveraging 18 years of experience in the healthcare industry as a hearing specialist to apply excellence in communication and creative problem-solving skills and a passion for data integrity and ethical data representation.

With a background in hearing aids, music, and martial arts, I specialize in communication and hard work.  I approach data analytics as a form of careful interpretation, translating complex questions into insightful answers and facilitating a meaningful conversation between stakeholders and their data.

I am passionate about maintaining fidelity in this translation and ensuring that, as we use data to represent people, we don't forget the people we are representing.  As such, I am first and foremost a storyteller: I listen to what the data has to say and carry that message to the people who need to hear it, as informative presentations, persuasive calls to action, or anything in between.

I also love to make data more accessible: creating beautiful and engaging visualizations that allow non-technical people to quickly see and interact with large amounts of information and make sense of it intuitively, enabling them to make decisions effortlessly and efficiently.  As someone who has worked in the arts for many years, I know how much time and effort it takes to clean things up behind the scenes so you can create something that looks pretty on the front end, and will spend hours pouring over the details to make it just right.
